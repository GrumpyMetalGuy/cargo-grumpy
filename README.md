# cargo-grumpy
Cargo utility to create and modify projects according to the Grumpy Way.

This wraps standard cargo calls to create new Rust projects, and adds a standard executable harness and the required dependencies to the Cargo.toml file. This is all very custom to how I do things, but you may find it useful!
